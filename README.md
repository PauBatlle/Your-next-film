# Your-next-movie

A ML-based movie recommendator system using LASSO, it is able to recommend the user with the next movie they should see based on their scores in previous movies. The web.html provied a frontend for the app, not linked to the jupyter notebook at the current time. The complete_filtering processes the data since the beginning (which can take a lot time, and therefore it is not recommended), and your-next-movie.html provides an example with already filtered data, which can be modified to try other recommendations.
